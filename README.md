# Synopsis
---
This project is designed to evaluate whether or not there a relationship has
developed between the amount of money a certain major tends to produce post-college and the popularity of a certain major.

# Motivation for this Project
---
Prior to my time in higher education, I thought that college/univerity students chose majors based on their fields of interests.
However, during my time in higher education, I have noticed that many of my peers seemingly are not interested in the majors that they 
partake in, rather, they are interested in the potential monetary value that the major could hold for them down the line after
graduation. This challenged my way of thinking.

Having found datasets that could potentially resolve my dilemma, I created this project to find evidence for either side.

# Installation
---

### Install Anaconda and Jupyter

This project runs on a Jupyter Notebook. Software is needed to be downloaded in order to be able to run this project.

Follow the instructions on this [webpage](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) and install the 
latest version in order gain access to Jupyter Notebook on your device.

### Cloning the Repository

To get the code to your computer, you must clone the repository into a directory on your device.

Step 1: Pick a directory/folder you wish to clone the repository to. This could be an existing directory or a new one that you can create of your own discretion. Keep this directory folder in mind for now. You will be needing it in the next step.

Step 2: Access the terminal on your device and change the directory to the one that you wish to clone the repository to.  

Step 3: Open the web browser of your choice and access the public github repository of this project (you should be on this page already if you're reading this)

Step 4: In the upper right-hand corner of the webpage, you should see a bright green button that says "Clone or download". Click this button to reveal options to get the SSH key.

Step 5: Press the "copy" button, which is illustrated as a clipboard. After pressing the button, you should get a message saying the SSH key has been copied.

Step 6: Return to your terminal. Enter the command "git clone <paste this SSH key you received in Step 5 here>". This should clone the current state of the repository into the folder of your choosing. You should now have access to your own copy of the repository for future use.

#Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. From your computer terminal, change directories until you enter the directory where you stored the copy of the reposistory

2. Once inside the correct directory, type in the command "<jupyter notebook Major_Evaluation.ipynb>" without the <"">. This should activate the kernel required to run the project and open a browser window where the jupyter notebook will appear with the project
