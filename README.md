This project is designed to evaluate whether or not there a relationship has
developed between the amount of money a certain major tends to produce post-college and the popularity of a certain major.

# Motivation for this Project
---
Prior to my time in higher education, I thought that college/univerity students chose majors based on their fields of interests.
However, during my time in higher education, I have noticed that many of my peers seemingly are not interested in the majors that they 
partake in, rather, they are interested in the potential monetary value that the major could hold for them down the line after
graduation. This challenged my way of thinking.

Having found datasets that could potentially resolve my dilemma, I created this project to find evidence for either side.
